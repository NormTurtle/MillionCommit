The main components are: 
1. [`entrypoint.sh`](https://github.com/FredaXin/gitlit/blob/main/entrypoint.sh): The shell script that contains the action code.
2. [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/FredaXin/gitlit/blob/main/Dockerfile): The Dockerfile that consists of instructions to build a Docker image and to execute `entrypoint.sh`.
3. [`action.yml`](https://github.com/FredaXin/gitlit/blob/main/action.yml): The action metadata file that defines the GitHub action. 

For more detailed information about how to create a custom Docker container action, see [GitHub's Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action).
